TheHive is a scalable 3-in-1 open source and free security incident response platform designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.

## Hardware Pre-requisites

TheHive uses ElasticSearch to store data. Both software use a Java VM. We recommend using a virtual machine with 8vCPU, 8
GB of RAM and 60 GB of disk. You can also use a physical machine with similar specifications.
